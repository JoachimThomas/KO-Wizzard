# AI Rules (strict)

- NO refactors, NO renaming, NO architecture changes.
- NO formatting-only edits.
- Only modify files that are explicitly whitelisted in the task.
- Keep diffs minimal and localized.
- Preserve separation: Views render only; logic/data live outside Views.
- Do not touch existing stable modules unless requested.
- If anything is unclear: stop and ask instead of guessing.
