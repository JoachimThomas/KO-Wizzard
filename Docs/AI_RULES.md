# AI Rules (strict)

- No refactors.
- No renaming of types/files/functions unless explicitly requested.
- No formatting-only changes.
- Only change files I explicitly allow (whitelist).
- Keep diffs minimal.
- Preserve existing architecture: Views are presentation only; logic and data are separated.
- If something is unclear: stop and ask instead of guessing.
